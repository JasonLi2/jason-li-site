Another drawing of Midoriya, but this time with color!

Had a really fun time working on this drawing as I had the opportunity to get a little creative with the shading of his hair and the shadows left by his hair. And in the end... it doesn't even matter (just kidding lol). And in the I think this overall illustration of Midoriya came out really nice. However, there are still some small little technical mistakes, like slips of the hand resulting in coloring out of the lines. The proportioning of his facial features, head, hair and torso all came out really nicely and luckily I had the perfect colors for the illustration too. Overall, very happy with this drawing and hope that things continue to go up from here!
