Here's a pencil drawing of Nishinoya from the anime "Haikyuu!!", the best sports anime in my opinion and one of my personal favorite shows. The cast of Haikyuu!! is one of the deepest I have ever seen in an anime, which in turn makes it very difficult for me to pick out a favorite from the cast, but everytime I sit down and give it some thought, it always comes down to Nishinoya or Oikawa. What really resonates with me when it comes to Nishinoya is his "never give up" attitude, relentless drive, and burning passion for volleyball.

I've always struggled with drawing hands, specifically when it comes to drawing them with the correct proportions and making them look natural. The problems I've had with drawing hands is what pushed me to draw something like this drawing of Nishinoya where his hand is a big focal point of the drawing and after a lot of erasing and starting over again, I finally ended up with a drawing that I am very happy with. I have considered creating and inked and fully-colored version of this drawing, but I am so pleased with how the drawing turned out after the initial pencil drawing that I am hesitant to do so as I feel like the current state of the drawing is so close to perfect.
