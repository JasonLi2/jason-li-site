Another drawing of Midoriya, but this time with color!

Had a really fun time working on this drawing as I had the opportunity to get a little creative with the shading of his hair and the shadows left by his hair. And in the end... it doesn't even matter (just kidding lol). And in the I think this illustration of Midoriya came out really nicely overall. The proportioning of his facial features, head, hair and torso all came out really nicely and luckily I had the perfect colors for the illustration too. Overall, very happy with this drawing and will try to improve from here.
