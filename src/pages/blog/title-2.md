Quick sketch of a young (top) and a present (bottom) version of Midoriya from "Boku no Hero Academia".

I always enjoy drawing Midoriya mainly because of his disheveled hair. Whenever I draw Midoriya's hair, I always feel like it provides a lot of freedom when it comes to drawing it since if some aspect of it is a little off, it still looks good because of it's naturally messy appearance.
